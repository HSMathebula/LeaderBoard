# HS-Game Leaderboard project

> JavaScript leaderboard project using API. Getting data form and sending data to API

![screenshot](./leaderboard.png)

## Description

In this project I setup a JavaScript project for the Leaderboard list app, using webpack and ES6 features. I developed a first working version of the app following a wire frame, with minimal styling. Secondly, Iconsume the Leaderboard API using JavaScript async and await and add some styling.

## Instructions:

### Phase 1, setup project

- Use [Gitflow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/gitflow.md)
- Create an npm project with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/output-management/#setting-up-htmlwebpackplugin)
- Write plain HTML markup with minimal styling (Creating the HTML structure), functionality first
- Don't make API calls (This is the second part of the project).
- Use ES6 modules, with import and export.

### Phase 2, hit the API

- Read the Leader board API documentation to learn how to use this API.
- Create a new game with the name of your choice by using the API.
- Implement the "Refresh" button (receiving data from the API and parsing the JSON).
- Implement the form "Submit" button (sending data to the API).
- Use `async` and `await` JavaScript features to consume the API.
- No styling is required.

### Phase 3, final touches

- At this point I have a fully working app that uses only basic styles to make the layout work.
- Now I improve the look and feel of the application, adding the styles of your choice.
- keeping the general layout of the wire frame, this is the only mandatory requirement.
- You can use plain CSS or any CSS framework, it's up to you.
